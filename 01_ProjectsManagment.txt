How Good Applications is developed:
  - Main Project  (exe)
  - Class Library Logger (logger.dll)
  - Class Libraary DB (db.dll)
  - Class Library WebConnector (webconnector.dll)

 - Modulrity
 - Each dll is responsible for specific domain 
 - BLACK BOX
 - Seperatiion of Development work
 - UnitTest / QA
